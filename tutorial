## Base Style

The simplest use of `spartan` is to instantiate it using

```import spartan as sp```.

This step customizes the default settings for `matplotlib`, which can then be used as usual. Changes to the style include:

* removal of unnecessary spines,
* a dim grid,
* a custom color palette,
* 16 point Arial font,
* fancy lengend,

and so on. This is implemented through the `spartan.mplstyle` file; all of the details can be found in that file. This may be most of what you need just to get a new look for your plots! 

In these example plots one sees the key differences.
