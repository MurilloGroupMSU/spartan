# Advanced Color Theory

Color plays an important role in communicating through visualization. Understanding color is not an easy task in part because of the required background knowledge physics, biologiy and technolgy. Perhaps equally challenging is finding a consistent description of color with enough details to not leave you scatraching your head. This webpage is an attempt to do that. If you are not interested in this level of detail and only wish to know the basics of how spartan uses color, this page might be more useful to you - (click here](color_theory.md).

Let's get started.

It is useful to break color science into three distinct areas: physics, biology and technology. Each of these areas treats color in quite different ways and without understanding each on its own terms, it is challenging to out them all together to understand what you are experiencing as you read this on your screen. Light is composed of colors and we need to understand how nature does that in terms of the laws that govern the universe. But, that light enters your eye and has a very complex interaction with the rods in cones in your retina, and that is before further processing in the topic nerve and brain. Then, there is the technology we have invented to mimic nature using what we know about our visual system.

### Physics

Before about a billion years ago there was, as far as we know, no life in the universe. While there was light, there were no animals to look at it. If there was a concept of color it was independent of biology and technology. What we know today is that light has always existed since the Big Bang and that it can be understood as being composed of electromagnetic waves. Those waves have various frequencies and form a spectrum; in fact, we should be careful when we use the term "light" because the electromagnetic spectrum is filled with waves no animal can see, if there were animals around to see things. Today, we give different parts of this spectrum names to help us keep things organized. When the energy in the wave is very large, we would call the radiation "gamma rays". In the opposite limit, the low energy waves are called "radio waves". Because these are waves, we can also consider their wavelength. Gamma rays have a very short wavelength (about 0.0000000000000001 meters), whereas radio waves have a very long wavelengths ( about 100000000 meters). 

Take a look at this picture (which is [from Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2521356). You can see some of the other names we have given these electromagnetic waves. You have certainly heard of x rays, since they are used for medical applications and you probably have used microwaves to heat your coffee. The important point ot remember is that all of these waves, from infrared to gamma rays to AM radio waves are all exactly the thing, just with different wavelengths (or, energies if you prefer to think about it that way). Because we use these waves in very different ways in our everyday lives, it is temping to think of the named waves is somehow different from the others. Fortunately, nature is simple when it comes to waves! In color theory the different electromagnetic waves are refereed to as the "spectrum". This refers to the electromagentic waves ("light") that exists independent of us.

The most important take-away from this section is that there electromagnetic waves filling the universe independent of any animal experiencing it. Those waves fill a continuous spectrum of different frequencies (or, equivalently, wavelengths).

### Biology

Let's now think about what happens when an electromagentic wave is sensed by a biological entity. There are numerous ways this can happen; for example, you might feel the heat of the sun on your skin. Many animals have such "light detectors" on their bodies, and early in our evolutionary history that is all we had. As evolution progressed, the detectors became more nuanced to help animals survive under the wide variety of conditions that animals experienced: some animals were strictly noctural, some lived deep in the ocean and some on land during the day. Importantly, animals mostly interact with a quite limited part of the electromagnetic spectrum that surrounds them. Why? At the highest frequencies (shortest wavelgnths) the radiation causes damage to molecules; it would be very difficult for a mechanism to evolve if the waves were destroying the molecules. At the other extreme, radio waves are so low in energy that they would be difficult to detect biologically. Thus, evolution has devloped strategies mainly in a narrow part of the electromagentic spectrum. 

Sensing radation early in the evolution of animals was mostly an "it is there, or not" situation, much like the example of feeling the sun on your skin. At a minimum, this gave some timing and directional information, which you can imagine gives a potentially huge advantage to animals that had this new capability. Imagine being totally blind, but you can feel light on your skin: you would be able to tell day from night, up from down. The types of cells that have this response are the nerve cells, which had already evolved for other reasons.
