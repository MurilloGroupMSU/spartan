# Advanced Color Theory

Color plays an important role in communicating through visualization. Understanding color is not an easy task in part because of the required background knowledge in physics, biology and technology. Perhaps equally challenging is finding a consistent description of color with enough details to not leave you scatraching your head. This webpage is an attempt to do that. If you are not interested in this level of detail and only wish to know the basics of how spartan uses color, this page might be more useful to you - [click here](color_theory.md).

Let's get started.

It is useful to break color science into three distinct areas: physics, biology and technology. Each of these areas treats color in quite different ways and without understanding each on its own terms, it is challenging to out them all together to understand what you are experiencing as you read this on your screen. Light is composed of colors and we need to understand how nature does that in terms of the laws that govern the universe. But, that light enters your eye and has a very complex interaction with the rods in cones in your retina, and that is before further processing in the topic nerve and brain. Then, there is the technology we have invented to mimic nature using what we know about our visual system.

### Physics

Before about a billion years ago there was, as far as we know, no life in the universe. While there was light, there were no animals to look at it. If there was a concept of color it was independent of biology and technology; who or what would have held this "concept"? What we know today is that light has always existed since the Big Bang and that it can be understood as being composed of electromagnetic waves. Those waves have various frequencies _f_ and form a spectrum (light with many values of _f_); in fact, we should be careful when we use the term "light" because the electromagnetic spectrum is filled with waves no animal can see, if there were animals around to see things. Today, we give different parts of this spectrum names to help us keep things organized. When the energy in the wave is very large, we would call the radiation "gamma rays". In the opposite limit, the low energy waves are called "radio waves". Because these are waves, we can also consider their wavelength. Gamma rays have a very short wavelength (about 0.0000000000000001 meters), whereas radio waves have a very long wavelengths ( about 100000000 meters). 


Take a look at this picture (thanks [Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2521356)). You can see some of the names we have given these electromagnetic waves. You have certainly heard of x rays, which have very large _f_, since they are used for medical applications and you probably have used microwaves, which have quite low values of _f_, to heat your coffee. The important point to remember is that all of these waves, from gamma rays to radio waves are all exactly the thing, just with different wavelengths (or, energies if you prefer to think about it that way). Because we use these waves in very different ways in our everyday lives, it is tempting to think of the named waves is somehow different from the others. Fortunately, nature is simple when it comes to waves! In color theory the different electromagnetic waves are refered to as the "spectrum"; sometimes we use language that the frequency _f_ is a "color". This use of the term "color" is part of why color theory is confusing: the electromagnetic waves ("light") exist independent of us and no account for nervous system has been made.

The terminology can get confusing, so let's summarize:
* light is electromagnetic waves,
* electromagetic waves are characterized by their frequency _f_,
* the light is there whether anything can detect it or not,
* the range of frequencies _f_ is truly enormous,
* we often refer to electromagnetic waves with different _f_ as having different "colors",
* just because we call this form of radiation "light", does not mean anything can "see" it.

Lasers are capable of producing radiation with a (nearly) single frequency. Imagine having an infinite number of these lasers, each of which produces electromagnetic radiation at a different frequency. By turning on all of the lasers at different levels we an create a distribution of frequencies that corresponds to, for example, the radiation or a tungsten light bulb. One of the confusing parts of color theory is that we often refer to these single frequencies as "color". As we will see, we should try to use another term, such as "physics color" or "single frequency radiation", because what animals actually experience as color is not this meaning of color.

What this picture of laser pointers illustrates (thanks [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_pointer)) is that there only two things we need to keep track of: the frequency and intensity of the electromagnetic wave. Or, if there are many frequencies, the intensities of each frequency, which is the "spectrum" of the radiation. In physics, this is all there is. Most of what you might have heard about color theory doesn't apply to the physical work; it isn't until animals detect this radiation that color theory gets complicated. Before moving on, take a moment to enjoy the simplicity that physics brings us! 


The most important take-away from this section is that there electromagnetic waves filling the universe; these waves are independent of any animal experiencing them. The waves fill a continuous spectrum of different frequencies (or, equivalently, wavelengths).

### Biology

Let's now think about what happens when an electromagentic wave is sensed by a biological entity. There are numerous ways this can happen; for example, you might feel the heat of the sun on your skin. Many animals have such "light detectors" on their bodies, and early in our evolutionary history that is all we had. As evolution progressed, the detectors became more nuanced to help animals survive under the wide variety of conditions that animals experienced: some animals were strictly noctural, some lived deep in the ocean and some on land during the day. Importantly, animals mostly interact with a quite limited part of the electromagnetic spectrum that surrounds them. Why? At the highest frequencies (shortest wavelgnths) the radiation causes damage to molecules; it would be very difficult for a mechanism to evolve if the waves were destroying the molecules. At the other extreme, radio waves are so low in energy that they would be difficult to detect biologically. Thus, evolution has devloped strategies mainly in a narrow part of the electromagentic spectrum. 

Sensing radation early in the evolution of animals was mostly an "it is there, or not" situation, much like the example of feeling the sun on your skin. At a minimum, this gave some timing and directional information, which you can imagine gives a potentially huge advantage to animals that had this new capability. Imagine being totally blind, but you can feel light on your skin: you would be able to tell day from night, up from down. The types of cells that have this response are the nerve cells, which had already evolved for other reasons.  Over time, nature explored many variants of detecting parts of the electromagenetic spectrum. In this simplest form, we can't really use the term "color"; in fact, for millions of years the nerves were not formed in what we would call an "eye". If you only have one detector and no true eye, you only get on and off; if the nerve cells form a simple imaging systems, a crude eye, you might refer to this as black and white vision. With only one type of detector, you have no sense of color. If you could scan across the spectrum, perhaps using all of those lasers discussed above, you would only exeperience lighter and darker sensations.
